# STROKE_PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
This project describes step-by-step procedure for building a machine learning (ML) model for stroke prediction and for analysing which features are most useful for the prediction.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The primary goal of this project is to predict whether a person could be at risk of having a stroke based on various features and medical data. Stroke prediction models like this can assist medical professionals in identifying high-risk individuals.
